    \class BoatModel

    \brief The Model for a Boat Position

    The class represents  the Model for a Boat, according to an
    Observer Pattern.

    BoatModel inherits PositionModel and contains data which represents
    one boat at a given time, like its position and heading.

    It shall not be mistaken with TrackModel, which holds the list of all
    positions where a Boat has navigated.
    More exactly, a TrackModel will hold a List of BoatModels.
